Sparse Table:

Range Max Query:

RMQ(0,0) RMQ(1,1) RMQ(2,2) ... RMQ(6,6)

RMQ(0,1) RMQ(1,2) ... RMQ(5,6)

RMQ(0,3) RMQ(1,4) ...

Query RMQ(0,5) = Max(RMQ(0,3), RMQ(2,5))

So for a sparse table to work, need an overlapping range query property (ranges maxed over can overlap).


Square Root Decomposition:
Q queries of (L, R) (number of distinct integers in A[L..R]): separate A into sqrt(N) buckets, sort the intervals by left boundary.
